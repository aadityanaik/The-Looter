You are in a forest, somewhere in the far north. The outskirts of
the village of Worfiskan are behind you. You face a set of ruins,
stone structures set up in front of a cave. You check your
inventory, making sure that you did not forget your sword and
shield. You light your torch and prepare yourself to go into the
cave.
