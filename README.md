# Railroad-Caper

A small, incomplete text based adventure game.


NOTE-
When downloading the source files to a computer, be sure to download all of them in a single folder.


Also Note- 
Linux systems don't work with this code, simply because of a goof up between the "\" in windows and the "/" in linux while making directories.
