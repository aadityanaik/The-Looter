NOTE-
When downloading the source files to a computer, be sure to download all of them in a single folder.
Also, the files named verb.dat and action.dat should be added in a sub-directory FOLDER\data\dictionary,
while those named start.dat and startlit.dat should be added in a sub-directory FOLDEER\data\rooms.
Create an empty file named Index.ind in the FOLDER\data sub-directory and an empty folder FOLDER\data\saves
